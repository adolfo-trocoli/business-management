Bussiness management app, capable of keeping register of employees, it's 
positions, salaries and other characteristics.

Every employee will have a unique id, a name, and a department.
Some employees have the title of manager, giving them special characteristics 
such as comission rate.
Every department will have a name, sells data and a Manager 
associated.


The app will be able to interpret commands in a shell-like style:

help - show help menu
add - add an employee or manager
dptadd - add a department
remove - remove an employee
dptremove - remove a department
edit - edit an employee
dptedit - edit a department
ls - list all employees and its characteristics
dptls - list all departments
show - show all information in database
...


The database will be implemented using a simple text file for each kind of 
object. In a file, each object (employee or department) will be written in a 
line.
